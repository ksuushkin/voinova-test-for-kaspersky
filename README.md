### This is my tesk task for Kaspersky Lab.

Download it and open index.html directly, no need to compile sass. 
Also you can see it in [github paages](https://ksuushkin.github.io/voinova-test-for-kaspersky/)

### Comments
I'm not sure if i got the design right (which area should be centered on tablet & desktop).
In case of a team work i would defenitely ask designer if it's what is supposed to be so we can manage the responsive behavior.
